# The Insurance Emporium - Tasks

# ANSWER:
The component I've chosen is the Notice component ( Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update ). 

The reason is because the user wouldn’t know that the component is clickable (on the website view). 
This is a very small impotent bit because if there are more components that need to be clicked to view information but it doesn’t tell the users that it is clickable. The user can spend more time on the website and create user traffic in the future as UX and UI are important. 

## How will I improve it?

I used **cursor: pointer** styles in order to indicate the user that this information is clickable on the **Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update**. 

Additionally, I added a **Log in** button on Navbar as it will help a user to log in to their profile easier instead of clicking through the Menu dropdown. 

( This section will be related to Task 2, which you can find on the index.html file)

## Given more time, what would you further improve? 
There are a few things that need to be improved. Mostly, they are on mobile view sites. So, when a user visited the website using mobile there are some components that don't work correctly or can be improved. 

NavBar : when visiting a website on mobile (using Safari Browser)

1. Get quotes online CTA (top right) and Request a callback - It disappears on the mobile site. This is an important action which should be promoted for users to do. Updating the site to include this on the homepage would improve UX. 
2. When clicking on Menu, the background blur but a user is still able to scroll the background. 
3. The slideshow doesn’t move properly. 
4. On **Menu -—> Existing Customers**: the front  or colour can be different on dropdown as it is difficult to identify between heading and subheading. One of the dropdown link opens a new tab when a user clicks on it such as: **My Emporium**.  This can be improved by having a login button on  Navbar (can be seen at: 'How will I improve it?' section above). 
5. On **Info Centre**: front or colour can be different on dropdown as it is difficult to identify between heading and subheading.
6. On **Info Centre**: the url route differently between **Covid-19 Help and Support** or **contact us** and the rest. If you can have a look into the link example:
